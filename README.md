# Steganography_Web_App
A web app that lets you hide/discover pictures inside other pictures. In the future I intend to make the algorithm more general and polish the interface


- I have 2 pictures: "landscape.jpeg" and "colors.png" to provide a demonstration of the application. Just set the app up and open
the html on your browser, there you can the read the instructions.

- Essentially, colors.png will be hidden inside landscape.jpeg(The server does the hidding).
- Then the picture with the hidden image is downloaded to the client.
- In case the client wants to uncover the original picture, it only has to send the hidden picture back to the server.
